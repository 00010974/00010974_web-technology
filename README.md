# Coursework - 1. Web Technology

I choose the "IT sphere" as the theme of my website due to its relevance now. In today’s worlds IT specialists are being one of the most important careers.  The IT programs are being used by a lot of people whole over the world. We used to get a lot of information from the internet and for me it was an amazing ability to feel myself a developer of own website and at the same time to show my skills gained from the web technology course. My work has been representing the IT courses named “Eden”(paradise), as the interpretation of pleasure of work. To be honest the work wasn’t easy for me at the beginning. I have had some issues like signs in wrong locations due to what all the codes showed errors, however, it has helped me to improve my skills and point at the work I should do in the future. Now I can see that the certain website can be easily code by me no more than in a one day, neither I tried for a weeks. I truly like my site for its comfort
